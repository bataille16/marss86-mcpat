Goal of the projec is to integrate marssx86 full system simulator with mcpat power modeling
to dynamically calculate power consumption of simulated workloads
Currently, the configuration parameters are hardcoded. The plan is to make the whole thing modular and easier to use. 

Project needs mcpat library in order to work.
